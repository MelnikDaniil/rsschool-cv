## **Summary and Skills**

At university, I studied C++ and C#. This gave me a basic knowledge of OOP, language syntax, a basic understanding of data structures (functions, structs, classes, etc.).

In the middle of university, I focused on project management and business analysis. Experience in this area greatly helped in building clear algorithms, setting up business processes, and team communication.

I finished Brother Anthony's school and learned the basics of Swift. With the help of RSSchool, I want to gain fundamental knowledge of Objective-C, Swift, and all the other tools and methodologies required for a high-quality development for IOS and other platforms.

## **Experience**

Since 2019 I have been working in a CRM studio as a project manager. I'm efficient at building algorithms, flowcharts, business processes. This background helps to systematize knowledge, find solutions, and decompose complex problems to clear action items. I learned how to delegate tasks efficiently and communicate competently with the team and various clients.

## **Education**
In 2019 I graduated from the Academy of Public Administration under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Belarus with a degree in information resource management.
In 2021 I studied at Brother Anthony's school and finished Swift courses.
## **English**
I have a strong A2+ level.
I can read documentation, understand speech, communicate verbally and write in English.
